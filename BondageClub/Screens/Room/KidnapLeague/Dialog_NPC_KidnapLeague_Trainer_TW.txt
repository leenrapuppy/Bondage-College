Brute force is good versus Domination and bad versus Sneakiness.  Brute force is halved if clothes are removed.

Domination consists of intimidating, insulting, and making your opponent feel weaker than you, which breaks their morale.
支配包括恐嚇、侮辱和讓你的對手感覺比你弱，這會破壞他們的士氣。
Domination is good versus Sneakiness and bad versus Brute force.  Domination is halved when gagged.

Meditation is used to recover.  If you use that move, you will get 8 new fresh moves that you'll be able to use in the next round.
冥想帶來恢復。如果你使用該動作，你將獲得8個新的動作，可以在下一輪使用。
Meditation is weak against everything, so you will probably take a hit when you use it, but come back stronger.

The strategy is using the right move at the right time and recovering when the timing is best.  Do not get caught off guard.  Anything else?
